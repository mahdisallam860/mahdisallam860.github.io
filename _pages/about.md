Hello! I'm Al Mahdi Sallam, a Mechatronics and Robotics Engineer based in Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

I am a passionate and dedicated engineering graduate from Universiti Teknologi Malaysia (UTM) with hands-on experience in robotics, AI, and automation. Currently, I work as a **Robotics Specialist at AMSY**, where I handle complex fabrication tasks by programming and optimizing KUKA robotic cells with Autodesk PowerMill, developing precision toolpaths, and implementing quality control procedures.

*<p style="text-align: center; font-style: italic;">Working with KUKA Robots at AMSY</p>*

My expertise includes robotic system design, AI-driven automation, and embedded systems. I am particularly skilled in programming for industrial robots, developing autonomous navigation systems using **ROS (Robot Operating System)**, and implementing machine learning models (like YOLOv5) for real-world applications like surface defect detection.

I've built my practical skills through international internships, including:
* **Robotics and AI Intern** at the KMITL - CIRA Lab in Thailand, where I designed a 4-DOF robotic arm for manufacturing inspection.
* **Automation Engineer Intern** with Pi Technology & Engineering in Malaysia, where I programmed and configured KUKA, ABB, and NACHI robots.

My academic work includes a capstone project on an autonomous pick-and-place robot and a final-year project focused on training a TurtleBot3 for autonomous navigation using Deep Q-Network (DQN) reinforcement learning algorithms.

I am a professionally accredited Engineer with the **Saudi Council of Engineers (SCE)** and an active member of the robotics community.

I'm always looking to connect and explore new career opportunities in the field of robotics and automation. Please feel free to browse my projects and publications, or check out my CV for more details.
